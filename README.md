# Automatic-Soil-Nutrient-Detection-and-Fertilizer-Dispensary-System
â€” Soil fertility is an important factor to measure the  quality of the soil as it indicates the extent to which it can support  plant life. The fertility of soil is measured by the amount of  macro and micronutrients, water, pH etc. Soil nutrients are  depleted after every harvest and hence must be replenished. To  maintain nutrient levels in the soil in case of deficiency, fertilizers  are added to soil. Most of the farmers choose to approximate the  amount of fertilizers and add them manually. However, addition  of fertilizers in right amount is a matter of great importance as  excess or insufficient addition can harm the plant life and reduce  the yield. Use of modern trends and technology promises to  provide a solution to the above problem. Though automated  techniques for seeding, weeding, harvesting the crops etc. have  been proposed and implemented, none of the techniques target at  maintaining soil fertility. The proposed research aims at  restoring the levels of Nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium in the  soil by the measuring the amount of nutrients present. The  presence of nutrients is determined by chemical processes and  quantified using sensors. An automated system has been  developed for the controlled addition of fertilizers in order to  avoid excess/ deficient fertilizers in the soil.
